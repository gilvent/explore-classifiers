# Overview
This repository is created as part of a class assignment. The main goal of this repository is to explore classifiers and classification evaluation methods.

## Classifiers
The classifiers explored in this project are:
* Logistic Regression for binary classification
* Logistic Regression for multinominal classification (using Softmax)
* Naive Bayes

## Classifier Evaluation
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC Curve and AUC score
* Other metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, Macro F1)
